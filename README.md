#DESCRIPTION: My domain is UI/UX design, and I worked with a **collaborative design workflow** using Figma. This approach allowed multiple team members to work on the same design project simultaneously, ensuring seamless coordination and version control. I utilized features like shared components, real-time feedback, and version history to streamline the design process. By organizing design elements into structured frames and components, I ensured consistency across the appâ€™s interface. Collaborating in Figma helped me understand the importance of teamwork in UI/UX design, as it enabled designers, developers, and stakeholders to provide instant feedback and iterate efficiently. This workflow improved productivity, reduced miscommunication, and ensured that design updates were easily accessible and modifiable for future enhancements.
